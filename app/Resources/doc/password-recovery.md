Password recovery
=================

To send the password recovery code, you need to send a GET request to the address 
`/api/v1/s/user/send-email/forgot` and pass the required parameters:
- email `string`

At the specified email address will come a letter, which contains the code for changing 
the password. To change the user's password, you must send a POST request to the address 
`/api/v1/s/user/change-password` and pass the required parameters:
- email `string`
- password `string` (new user password)
- code `string` (code from the letter)
